# Fibonacci Numbers

## Calculation

### Recursion

f(0) = 0

f(1) = 1

f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)

### Closed Form

The n-th Fibonacci number can also be calculated in closed form ( "Binet's formula"), using the "golden ratio" value.

### Matrix form

 A way to compute Fibonacci numbers recursively in O(log(n)) arithmetic operations and in time O(M(n) log(n)), where M(n) is the time for the multiplication of two numbers of n digits.
